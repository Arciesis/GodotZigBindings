# Zig lang bindings for Godot GDExtension

For Zig Version 0.11.0 and Godot 4.0.0 (Work In Progress)

If you are looking for the GDNative Godot 3.0.0 bindings [**click here**](https://github.com/thimenesup/GodotZigBindings/commit/e49363b4035fc7dac5e53da0dccdd9455704b51c)

## Package Usage

Before you use this as a package, you must generate the GDExtension and class files for Zig, this is done by building with the following options

```
zig build -Dgdextension="mydir/extension_api.json" -Dbuild_config="float_64"
```

The gdextension file can get generated by running the engine with the following CLI command "--dump-extension-api"
The build configuration should match the engine bits and float/double types that was built with

## Example usage

The "test_example" folder contains an explained minimal example of how to use this as a package, with the build script, library entry point and a sample class included that can be built with

```
zig build
```
